# MOJ checkout take home challenge

Shopping Cart Checkout Problem Description
In our quest to stay in touch with what's going on in the commercial world we've decided to open a supermarket - we sell only three products:
Product code
Name
Price
FR1
Fruit tea
£3.11
SR1
Strawberries
£5.00
CF1
Coffee
£11.23
Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers. She wants us to add a rule to apply this rule to fruit tea.
The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to £4.50 each.
Our checkout can scan items in any order.
The CEO and COO change their minds often, so ideally this should be a flexible solution (if you have time). For example, we might want to apply the offers to different products, or add products to our range, as the supermarket grows.
Task
Your goal is to implement a checkout that scans items in and calculates total prices correctly for any combination of the products and offers above.
After your interview, you’ll be asked to talk through your code, and share your screen to demonstrate it. Don’t worry about using databases or a front end.
Please don’t spend more than an hour or two on this. An incomplete solution is ok, we can talk through how you’d extend your solution at the interview. Thank you, and good luck!
